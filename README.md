# watermark-image-creator
This Python algorithm takes a watermark png file, which needs to be white text on black background, and the photo that's going to be watermarked and then puts them on top of one another.

!IMPORTANT!
Note that the algorithm uses openCv, and you're going to need to install it in your VENV.
I suggest you use
# pip install opencv-python	4.1.2.30
